Docker container running [OpenSky Network's](https://opensky-network.org/)'s `opensky-feeder`. Designed to work in tandem with [sdr-enthusiasts/docker-readsb-protobuf](https://github.com/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-readsb-protobuf). Builds and runs on `x86_64`, `arm64`, `arm32v7` and `386`.

`opensky-feeder` pulls ModeS/BEAST information from a host or container providing ModeS/BEAST data, and sends data to OpenSky.

For more information on what `opensky-feeder` is, see here: <https://opensky-network.org/community/projects/30-dump1090-feeder>.

## Supported tags and respective Dockerfiles

* `latest` (`master` branch, `Dockerfile`)
* `latest_nohealthcheck` is the same as the `latest` version above. However, this version has the docker healthcheck removed. This is done for people running platforms (such as [Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io)) that don't support manually disabling healthchecks, where healthchecks are not wanted.
* Version and architecture specific tags available

## Obtaining an OpenSky Network Feeder Serial Number

First-time users should obtain a feeder serial number.

Firstly, make sure you have registered for an account on the [OpenSky Network website](https://opensky-network.org/), and have your username on-hand.

In order to obtain a feeder serial number, we will start a temporary container running `opensky-feeder`, which will connect to OpenSky Network and be issued a serial number. The container will automatically be stopped and cleaned up after 60 seconds.

To do this, run the command:

```shell
timeout 60s docker run \
    --rm \
    -it \
    -e LAT=YOURLATITUDE \
    -e LONG=YOURLONGITUDE \
    -e ALT=YOURALTITUDE \
    -e BEASTHOST=YOURBEASTHOST \
    -e OPENSKY_USERNAME=YOUROPENSKYUSERNAME \
    ghcr.io/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-opensky-network:latest
```

Be sure to change the following:

* Replace `YOURLATITUDE` with the latitude of your antenna (xx.xxxxx)
* Replace `YOURLONGITUDE` with the longitude of your antenna (xx.xxxxx)
* Replace `YOURALTITUDE` with the altitude above sea level of your antenna *in metres*
* Replace `YOURBEASTHOST` with the IP or hostname of your Beast provider (`readsb`/`dump1090`)
* Replace `YOUROPENSKYUSERNAME` with your OpenSky Network username

Once the container has started, you should see a message such as:

```text

[s6-init] ensuring user provided files have correct perms...exited 0.

```

As you can see from the output above, we've been allocated a serial number of `-1408234269`.

Failure to specify the `OPENSKY_SERIAL` environment variable will cause a new feeder serial to be created every time the container is started. Please do the right thing and set `OPENSKY_SERIAL`!

## Up-and-Running with `docker run`

```shell
docker run \
 -d \
 --rm \
 --name opensky \
 --network=ADSBNET \
 -e TZ="YOURTIMEZONE" \
 -e BEASTHOST=YOURBEASTHOST \
 -e LAT=YOURLATITUDE \
 -e LONG=YOURLONGITUDE \
 -e ALT=YOURALTITUDE \
 -e OPENSKY_USERNAME=YOUROPENSKYUSERNAME \
 -e OPENSKY_SERIAL=YOUROPENSKYSERIAL \
 ghcr.io/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-opensky-network:latest
```

Be sure to change the following:

* Replace `YOURLATITUDE` with the latitude of your antenna (xx.xxxxx)
* Replace `YOURLONGITUDE` with the longitude of your antenna (xx.xxxxx)
* Replace `YOURALTITUDE` with the altitude above sea level of your antenna *in metres*
* Replace `YOURBEASTHOST` with the IP or hostname of your Beast provider (`readsb`/`dump1090`)
* Replace `YOUROPENSKYUSERNAME` with your OpenSky Network username
* Replace `YOUROPENSKYSERIAL` with your OpenSky feeder serial
* Replace `ADSBNET` with the name of your docker network containing your `BEASTHOST`.

For example:

```shell
docker run \
 -d \
 --rm \
 --name opensky \
 --network=adsbnet \
 -e TZ="Australia/Perth" \
 -e BEASTHOST=10.0.0.1 \
 -e LAT=-33.33333 \
 -e LONG=111.11111 \
 -e ALT=100.8 \
 -e OPENSKY_USERNAME=johnnytightlips \
 -e OPENSKY_SERIAL=-1408234269 \
 ghcr.io/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-opensky-network:latest
```

Please note, the altitude figure is given in metres and no units should be specified.
